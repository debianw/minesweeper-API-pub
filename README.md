# minesweeper-API

[Demo here](https://minesweeper-debianw.herokuapp.com/)

## Notes
* Base implementation of a REST API
* Front End implementation of the Game using (React / Redux) [ source code here ](https://github.com/debianw/minesweeper-APP)
* Persisting game in Mongo database
* apiDoc standard comments for endpoints documentation 

## Missing parts
Due to this is consuming a lot of time I'm missing some parts of the game like:

* Flag implementation
* Reveal adjacents
